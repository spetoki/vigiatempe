# **App Name**: GeoLocator

## Core Features:

- Geolocation Acquisition: Get user's geolocation (latitude and longitude) using the browser's built-in geolocation API.
- Coordinate Display: Display the user's latitude and longitude on the page. Format as a digital readout.
- Copy to Clipboard: Allow the user to copy the coordinates to the clipboard with a single click.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF), symbolizing location and precision.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF), a lighter shade of blue, very desaturated.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), brighter than the primary to signal actions or key information.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface for both headers and body copy, creating a clean, readable interface.
- Simple, flat icons for actions like 'copy to clipboard' to keep the UI uncluttered.
- Clean, minimalist layout, emphasizing the geolocation data, presented centrally.
- Subtle animation or transition effect when geolocation data is successfully acquired.
